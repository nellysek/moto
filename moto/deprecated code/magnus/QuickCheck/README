This folder contains a QuickCheck test for the function moto_map() and
the moto_map() function in an own c-module, taken out of its context due
to restrictions in QuickChecks ability to test code in complete systems.
The code is actually not deprecated, but it does not fit in elsewhere in the
repository.
