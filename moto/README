README for the moto folder.

Typing make in terminal from this folder will produce following information:
###########################################################################
make pc     produces binary in bin/
make mega   produces binary for the Arduino and uploads
            to the board
 
--- Cleaning up -----------------------------------------
make clean    recursively clean up subdirs
 
--- Verification and debugging --------------------------
make pc-dbg       produces debug modebinary in bin/
make test         compiles unit tests
make unit         compiles and runs unit tests
make gcov         run unit tests with gcov (statement coverage)
make gcov2        run unit tests with gcov (branch coverage)
                  need to have LCov 1.9 installed!
make valgrind     run unit tests with valgrind
###########################################################################

Read the information carefully, especially when it comes to the part
about gcov2.

Note: When a make is made for pc, pc-dbg or valgrind a separate main.c is
      required. The quickest way to produce this is to go into the /src folder
      and open the README file there. In that file there is code to copy/paste
      into a new file which then is to be saved as main.c
      
      Make and be happy! /Motor group
